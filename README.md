This app allows to get basic informacion about Pokemons, which is downloaded originaly of The RESTful Pok√©mon API ( https://pokeapi.co/). 
the exposure of three specific query services called pokemon-api, poke-img-url, poke-desc and pokevolution was revised. the first of these works by passing as reference the name or the id of the pokemon, the others work only with the id.
These services can be consumed directly from the url and are used for the operation of the application.
